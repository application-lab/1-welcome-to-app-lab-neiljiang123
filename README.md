# About Me
Hello! My name is Lai Jiang and you can also call me Neil and I live in Deyang,Sichuan China. I enjoy watching movies and listening to pop music.I am genuinely into the preservation of languages and local dialects and am a language lover myself. I choose to apply to NYUshanghai because I recognize the benefits of studying in an international community.

I'm a member of NYU Shanghai class of 2023, China's first Sino-American university's 7th class.I hope with our joint effort, NYUshanghai is going to be widely known both in China and around the world. Currently I am considering about majoring in IMA, while I'm also thinking about taking a minor in Global China Studies.

A fun fact about me is that I can speak Dutch well,which enables me to start enjoyable conversations with people from the Netherlands,Belgium and South Africa.I pride myself on speaking Sichuan dialect since dialects in many regions in mainland China have not been protected well due to the urbanization.Although I have no previous programnming experiences,I want to explore more in the programming world:)
